<p>Basic Movement</p>
<p>The first thing that I am going to cover is just basic movement. All images in this guide are taken from game gardens so don't worry that they are different to what you see on puzzle pirates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In battle navigation there are three movement tokens that you can use: Forward, left and right. </p>
<p><img src="http://img388.imageshack.us/img388/3995/picture1xl4.png" alt="Image Hosted by ImageShack.us"/></p>
<p>These are the three main tools that you will use to make your way around a bnav board.<br />

<p>This is just a basic picture of a bnav board to illustrate what each of the movement tokens do. Going forward is fairly simple, it just moves your ship forward up the screen. Each time you enter a forward into the box it will move one square in whatever direction you are facing.</p>
<img src="http://img232.imageshack.us/img232/8910/basicmovementgoingforwaqy7.png" alt="Image Hosted by ImageShack.us"/><span class="style1"> Four images of going forwards - one for each direction
</span>
<p>If you turn, then it moves you forwards and then into the adjacent square appropriate for your turn AND rotates your ship 90 degrees clockwise for a right turn, or 90 degrees anti-clockwise for a left.  </p>

  Turning Right <br />
<img src="http://img232.imageshack.us/img232/4743/basicmovementturninglefdn5.png" alt="Image Hosted by ImageShack.us"/>Turning Left</p>
<p>These images show what happens if you keep turning left or right repeatedly.</p>
<p>If you combine more than one in a single turn then it simply executes each move one after another.<br />
For example:</p>
<p> Forward left right</p>
<img src="http://img232.imageshack.us/img232/8919/basicmovementforwardlefhp5.png" alt="Image Hosted by ImageShack.us"/>
<p>Forward Right Left  </p>

<p>Ways to put in your moves</p>
<p><img src="http://img232.imageshack.us/img232/6527/viewofmoveinputgl4.png" alt="Image Hosted by ImageShack.us"/></p>
<p>There are two main ways to put your moves in, the first is to simply click on the boxes which will change that move. It will cycle through the moves from <br />
Nothing--&gt;Left--&gt;Forward--&gt;Right--&gt;Nothing <br />
Right clicking on a square will go through the cycle in the opposite order and middle clicking will put in a forwards, so quite naturally you will left click to go left, right click for right and middle click for forwards. This is the fastest and easiest way to put in your moves.</p>
<p>The other option is to drag tokens, just take a token from on the left and drag it over the relevant slot that you want to place it in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Move Execution</p>
<p>Moves are executed from the top down to the bottom, first the move in the top box is executed and then it works down the list.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use this simulator to move your ship around the board to see what each move does </p>

<p>Try the basic quiz below by dragging the correct pieces to represent what is being shown. If you want to change your mind please use the reset button - don't just drag pieces off.</p>
