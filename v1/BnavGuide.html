<p>Credits<br />
Information on how ships work taken from the thread <a href="http://forums.puzzlepirates.com/community/mvnforum/viewthread?thread=73211">here</a> was used by myself in creating the customizable ships<br />
The large majority of replicating the bnav interface for the simulators and creating the various challenges was done by myself with assistance from timdc<br />
The large majortity of the work on how the AI for the simulators work has been done by timdc with assistance from me<br />
All of the guides and content was created by myself<br />
There is no hatred towards dalnoth I just wanted to shoot at him from a sloop in a game and then felt like I should stick to the same theme &lt;3 </p>
