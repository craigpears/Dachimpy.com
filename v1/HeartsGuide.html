<p>Hearts Strategy</p>
<p><b>Passing Strategies</b></p>
<p><u>Never pass regular spades!</u></p>
<p>One simple first step is to never pass any spades other than the queen, king or ace unless you plan to shoot the moon.  These cards protect you from taking the queen of spades and should always be kept.</p>
<p><u>Discarding all of one suit</u></p>
<p>Discarding all of one suit does several things.</p>
<p>Firstly it makes discarding problematic cards during the game far easier if you successfully discard all of one suit without having them passed to you from the other player.  The biggest problematic card is the queen of spades, after that comes the ace and king of spades, and then high hearts or other risks to take the queen of spades.  Having no diamonds or clubs means that you can easily discard any of these problematic cards.</p>
<p>Secondly it stops your opponents doing the same tactic!  Imagine the player you are passing to is trying to get rid of diamonds in the same way as you, if you pass him his diamonds back it stops his tactic entirely.</p>
<p>However, if you pass all of one suit these cards will tend to be lower and do less damage to the person you are passing to.  Also if you discard all of your suit and get give very high cards in that suit you have no way of ducking hands.</p>
<p><u>Insurance Pass</u></p>
<p>An insurance pass is a pass that makes sure that the person you are passing to is unable to shoot the moon.  The principal is quite simple, give them a heart that you know you can beat if you see they are trying to shoot.  If you have the 23JA of hearts, passing them the jack and reserving your ace means that it is impossible for them to shoot the moon.</p>
<p>When to pass the queen of spades and when to keep it</p>
<p>Having the queen of spades can either be a huge advantage, or the worst problem in hearts.  It is quite easy to figure out whether to pass or keep it however.</p>
<p>If you have the queen the decision of who receives it is up to you, so it is quite easy to target the person who is in the lead.  However faliure means that you are given it yourself.</p>
<p>The first thing you need is backup spades, if you have less than three spades it is a suicidal idea to keep the queen because you will be forced to play it too soon but having a large number of spades means that this won't happen.zz</p>
<p>The second thing is what other cards you have.  If you have a large number of problematic cards elsewhere such as nothing but high hearts and are fairly safe in spades then it may be a good idea to discard these.  If you are able to discard all of one suit the queen will be very easy to get rid of.</p>
<p>Minimise your chances to take the queen before anything else! And then hearts!</p>
<p>The first priority of all games should be to avoid taking the queen.  Having no cards that you can be used to duck the queen in a suit is very dangerous and it is probably a good idea to pass these.  After you are safe from the queen or have done all you can concentrate on hearts! It doesn't matter if you take all the clubs or diamonds as long as you don't take any heart or the queen of spades.  Avoiding hearts should be your second priority in the game.</p>
<p><b>Shooting the moon!</b></p>
<p>Shooting the moon is where you take all the hearts and the queen of spades.  It gives every other person 26 points unless it would cause the person to lose the game in which case the player that shot the moon would lose 26 points themselves.</p>
<p>Shooting the moon requires alot of high dominating cards with little to no chance of anyone taking a heart other than you. Almost always you must dominate hearts, the reason for this being that most experienced players will pass you a heart that they can cover meaning your shoot will fail unless you have the high hearts.  Generally you need at least the ace, king and queen of hearts to support your other high cards in the shoot else these cards can take one of the heart tricks if you get passed a low heart.</p>
<p><u>What cards to pass</u></p>
<p>When shooting the moon obviously any high cards you want to keep.  However! Getting rid of your low cards is also a large mistake that people make.  If you have 3 middle cards and 3 low cards that you have to discard before you can shoot then it is much better to discard middle value cards rather than the low ones for two reasons.  Firstly a low pass will warn the person that you are trying to shoot and they will do everything they can to stop you(However I have yet to see a person willing to take the queen of spades to stop a shoot) and secondly if you fail your shoot you still have low cards to be able to duck with, if you pass all your low cards and your shoot fails you are committed to taking almost all of the points but if you pass your medium cards you still have a chance to duck some of them.</p>
<p><u>When playing the hand</u></p>
<p>By this stage you should have identified both which cards you must discard before you start to shoot, and what potential cards can stop you.  Try and make the other players play most of the problematic cards to stop your shoot before you reveal your intentions, for example a queen of clubs is an easy card that will most likely be thrown down in the first hand.</p>
<p>If you have been dealt an insurance pass that is a medium heart - always start your shoot on this hand if you don't have enough high hearts to cover it.  If this is the first heart you play there is still a chance that people will duck it unsure of whether you are shooting or not.  Once all the problematic cards are out and you have discarded all your low cards its quite straight forward - just take every single trick and start to shoot.  If it is still unsure go for the hearts first, there may still be a chance to duck the queen of spades if your shoot fails.</p>
<p><b>Strategies to force another player to take the queen</b></p>
<p><u>Forcing spades to bring out the queen.</u></p>
<p>One of the most basic strategies in hearts, Play alot of spades and force the person with the queen of spades to play it, or a person with the ace or king to play that and get hit with the queen themselves.</p>
<p>For this strategy to work the person with either the queen or Ace/King must have a low number of spades, if they have a large number they will simply keep ducking you or in the case of the ace or king they can simply be the last to act and play the card safely.  Also you must not hold the ace or king yourself if you don't have a large amount of small spades to back this up.</p>
<p>Remember to count cards!  If for example you hold 4 spades and after playing two only one person has spades left, this means they have far more than you do and other strategies to force out the queen should be considered.</p>
<p><u>Playing low cards to bring out the queen</u></p>
<p>If you have a large number of cards in one suit this is a very easy way to make sure the queen gets given early.  Doing this definitely requires counting cards.  You start with 13 of each suit - Count what clubs for example you have.</p>
<p>Example</p>
<p>You hold 34589A clubs, you already have 6 of the thirteen clubs. The first trick is lead by the 2, the King and 6 of clubs get played ahead of you.  Examine what cards are left! there are only the 7,10, Jack and queen remaining in other players hands.  All of these hands can be easily ducked by you, so by playing the ace so that you can play a low club again you know there is no way you are going to be given the queen because at least one person has a club higher than yours.  Simply keep coming back and forcing low clubs until either it is obvious there is only one other person left with clubs and they are the one with the queen or until there are no other clubs remaining except yours.</p>
<p>If after taking the hand you played the 3 of clubs, one threw down an ace of spades and the other two revealed two clubs - The 7 and jack, then you are still safe because you have the ten to cover you and have also found out that the person that played the Ace of spades does not have the queen.  However if that person had played the ten there are now no other cards to cover you so the tactic has failed.</p>
<p><u>Duck hands</u></p>
<p>If you have already determined who you think has the queen, always try and duck the hands that you are playing where they are yet to act or if they have already acted get rid of your high problematic cards.</p>
<p>Reading your opponents to locate the queen</p>
<p>There are several easy ways to find out who has the queen of spades in hearts.</p>
<p>Firstly, the person with the queen of hearts will always want something to be played other than spades.  Somebody that is agressively forcing spades to be played most likely does not have the queen.  A second thing to look for could be how they respond to spades being played, someone with the queen or low number spades that holds the ace or king will not want any more to be played.  They will either play submissively and duck all of the plays in spades or take the hand and force another suit to be played so that they can discard their queen.</p>
<p>#1 A person with the queen of hearts won't want spades to be played because they will want to discard it.  Anyone that is agressively playing spades generally will not have the queen.</p>
<p>#2 If spades are played a person with the queen won't want this to continue, if they keep taking spades and then playing something else this means they are scared of spades in most cases meaning either they hold the queen, king or ace of spades and don't want the play to continue.</p>
<p>#3 Quite simple, if you have the queen then... you know who has the queen! you!</p>
<p>#4 If you have passed the queen again, quite simple to know who has it.</p>
<p>#5 If someone has completely discarded all of one suit and plays a different card (e.g. clubs were lead and they played a heart) then unless there is a very good reason for them to hold the queen they won't have it.  However there are alot of reasons possible for this: Basic idiocy, they may feel safe in spades and be getting rid of more troublesome cards (e.g. have 6 spades and only the ace of hearts), later in the game they may be targetting the player with the lowest score and be reserving the queen for them, or they may be planning on shooting.</p>
<p>#6 Being passed all of one suit, If someone has given you a pass of three medium diamonds this is done for one of two reasons, either a shoot or to discard all of one suit.  Be very aware if you receive one of these passes and try to either stop the shoot or be aware that this is a suit that will be hit by the queen very easily if that person holds it.</p>
<p><u>Stopping shooters!</u></p>
<p>Getting rid of all your high cards will usually be a good idea but beware shooters! If you hold high hearts they may be the only thing that a shooter is waiting for, before playing things such as the ace of hearts always make sure that it is impossible for a person to shoot the moon by either taking a trick or making two people take hearts.</p>
