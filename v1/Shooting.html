<p>Guns</p>
<p>One of the most fun things of bnav, shooting things! </p>

<p>The input for guns are the circles on each side of the ship. Clicking the circle puts guns in, the next click will put in a grapple(covered later) and another click will remove the guns. The circles on the right hand side fire out of the right of the ship and vice versa with the left. Remember there are three movement stages! The guns will only fire after the ship has moved and any tiles are taken into effect. So if you are in a wind or a whirlpool you will be moved before you fire.</p>
<p>Range: A cannonball can shoot three tiles either way unless there is an obstacle such as a ship or large rock - small rocks can be fired over.</p>
<p>Here is a small game where you shoot at a picture of dalnoth! Practice hitting the different pictures from different positions using the wind and whirlpools to get to the further away targets.</p>
