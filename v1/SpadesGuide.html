<p><strong>Spades Guide</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Calculating your tricks</strong></p>
<p>Most of the tricks that you can take are fairly obvious.</p>
<p>#1 Any aces or kings in regular suits = one trick UNLESS you either have only the king and no other card for when the ace is played, or you have alot of that suit. If you have 8 hearts for example and you have the ace king queen of hearts, odds are that you will only get one trick or two if you are lucky before an opponent plays a spade against your trick. </p>
<p>#2 Having a low number of cards in a suit = If you don't have many in one suit then you will be able to spade tricks in it, this has both advantages and disadvantages. The advantages are that you can steal tricks that your opponent included in their bid to set them, the other is that you CHOOSE whether to take the point or not - In the case of having for example the ace of spades you are forced to take that point but if you are spading other peoples tricks it is your choice depending on if you think you are likely to bag or not. The disadvantage is that the trick you are expecting to hit with spades could very well be your partners trick! So don't heavily rely on these bids else you could very easily conflict with your partner. </p>
<p>#3  Having a large number of spades = This is similar to having a low number of cards in a suit but if you have a very high number of spades you will still be able to play spades long after your opponents have all ran out to steal a few extra tricks.</p>
<p>#4 Nilling = If you want to nill you must consider two things. What the other people have bidded and what cards you have. If your partner is bidding high and your opponents low this means you have a very good cover and are more likely to make your nill even with a few high cards. </p>
