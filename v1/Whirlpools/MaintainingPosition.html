<p>Maintaining Position</p>
<p>Some times you are in a whirlpool and don't want to move, you would rather stay still for that turn. This is possible in certain parts of the whirlpool.</p>

<p>Turning left in the whirlpool </p>
<p>Facing this way in a whirlpool you can turn to counter-act what the whirlpool does and therefore stay in the same position. Turning moves you to the opposite square and rotates you, then the whirlpool actions simply undo that turn. You can do this for as many times as you want to stay in that position.</p>

<p>Turning right in the whirlpool </p>
<p>If you are able to turn right in the whirlpool you again are able to counter-act what the whirlpool does by staying in the same square, however turning right in a whirlpool also changes the direction you are facing. You can only do this once to stay in position. </p>

<p>Facing the outside of the whirlpool  </p>
<p>If you are facing the outside of the whirlpool there is no way to maintain your position using the whirlpool itself. </p>

<p>Facing the outside of the whirlpool with a wind pointing towards the whirlpool</p>
<p>In this position you can go forwards into the wind, and get pushed back to maintain your position as many times as you want. </p>
