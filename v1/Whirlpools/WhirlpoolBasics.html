<p>Whirlpools are the thing that most people have trouble with so I have split it up into several sections.</p>
<p>Whirlpools basically just rotate you 90 degrees and move you to the other side of the whirlpool as you can see in the little animation above. It is VERY important that you completely understand whirlpools before you try to bnav, one of the biggest problems I see is that people spend half of their time trying to figure out how to move and how to use the whirlpools and not concentrating on how to actually hit the brigand/barbarian.</p>
<p>Whirlpool Effects: <br />
1. Go to the opposite square<br />
2. Rotate 90 Degrees</p>
<p>If you don't understand rotating by 90 Degrees here is an illustration of what happens to the ship each time it goes through a 90 degree rotation</p>

<p>Here is a map for you to play on with a whirlpool to let you experiment with how they work.</p>

<p>Try and master every part of the quiz, use the animations or simulator to help you find out which comes next if you get stuck. The picture on the left hand side is the starting position and the four pictures on the right hand side are four possible positions that the ship could be in after the whirlpool moves the ship(once) click on the right answer. </p>
