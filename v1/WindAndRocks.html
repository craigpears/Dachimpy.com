<p>Bnav would be pretty boring if it was just a big empty board. That's why they throw in three special types of square to frustrate you! &lt;3 aren't they kind.</p>
<p>There are several stages to move execution, First it takes your first move and executes it, Secondly it looks for any special tiles such as wind or a whirlpool and Thirdly then fires any guns/grapples.</p>
<p>Whirlpools are quite hard to understand so I will leave that to its own set of pages because it is very important you know how to do everything with whirlpools before trying to learn how the bots act. </p>

<p>These are rock and wind tiles. Rocks are a special tile that you simply cant pass over, if you ram into them you recieve damage and will simply bounce off. The edges of the map act the same as rocks. Winds are a special tile that would you believe it act as wind! If you go over one of these tiles it will move you in the direction that the wind is pointing - If this happens to be a rock it will simply bounce off. </p>
<p>Order of execution:</p>
<p>1. Execute the first move<br />
  2. Perform any wind/whirlpool actions<br />
  3. Fire guns/grapple<br />
  4. Execute the second move
  <br />
5. etc.</p>
<p>If there is no move to execute it will still perform one wind/whirlpool action but only one. If you have a long stream of winds it will not instantly move you across all of them - It will do one at a time for each move. Here is an example one move at a time of a ship in some wind. </p>

<p>Test it out until you are comfortable with how the wind works and how bumping off rocks works.</p>
