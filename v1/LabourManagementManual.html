<p>Labour Management Manual</p>

<p>When you first open the database you will be presented with this form which links to all the functions the database provides.</p>
<p>Create New Pirate: Add a new pirate to your database<br />
  Manage Pirates: Manage the details of each pirate such as their skills and what shops they have jobs at<br />
New Shop: Add a new shop to the database<br />
Manage Shop: View the details of labour output in each shop and the status of the alts employed there</p>
<p><img src="http://www.freewebs.com/dachimpy/AddNewPirate.png" width="219" height="250" /> </p>
<p>Most of this form is fairly straight forward and doesn't need any explanation.<br />
Most alts in my experience only have one skill type but more can be added later via the Manage Pirates form.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.freewebs.com/dachimpy/AddNewShop.png" width="226" height="134" /></p>
<p>Again a very simple form with no explanation needed.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.freewebs.com/dachimpy/ManagePirates.png" width="610" height="278" /> </p>
<p>This form is where you manage all the information on each individual Pirate.<br />
  On the left is a list of all the pirates currently in the database, just click on one to bring up the information for it.<br />
To appear in a shop's list of employees an alt must take a job, to do that simply choose the shop from the dropdown box in the Take new job area and choose take job.  To quit do the same in the quit job box. (Known Bug: Unable to quit first job, if you really need to do this you must delete the entry via the tables)<br />
If the pirate has any 
jobs or skills the information will be shown in the boxes in the top right. To edit a pirates skills enter the information into the add/update skill box.</p>

<p>This is the screen that you will come to most often to check what alts are about to undormant.</p>
<p>The labour output displays the maximum output your alts will send to this shop - Note that this is a maximum, if your alts have several jobs then this figure will be incorrect (realistically aswell alts only provide 90% of what they are capable in a single shop) </p>
<p>The dormanting workers list will display any workers that are within a day or two of undormanting IN ANY SHOP.</p>
<p>The active workers list displays all active workers that are in the currently selected shop</p>
<p>To update a worker FIRST select the relevant shop type, it doesn't really matter which one as long as it is the same type. If you don't do this you will recieve an EOF error as the database will search for a skill that does not exist or it will change the wrong skill. After this it is a simple case of entering the pirate name and selecting one of the options below (Skill level is only needed if you are updating it) </p>
<p>Known Bugs: If an alt has several jobs it will appear several times in the Dormanting Workers list</p>
