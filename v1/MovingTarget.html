<p>Moving Target</p>
<p>Dalnoth has decided he doesn't like just sitting there and getting shot! He is now roaming around the board trying to get away from you. All those cannonballs to the head knocked what tiny bit of sense he had out of him so expect alot of random aiming into walls! &lt;3</p>
<p>Remember that there are health bars now! If you crash into a rock/collide with dalnoth then you get dealt .5 damage, a cannonball hit into Dalnoth is worth 1. Track him down until he has no health remaining!</p>
