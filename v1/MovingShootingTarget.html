<p>Dalnoth is really getting aggitated now, he is starting to load his guns! But again he has taken a few too many hits to the head and cant make sense of which way to fire so has just decided to pick any random cannon. This time you will have the challenge of hitting dalnoth without being hit yourself too much.</p>
