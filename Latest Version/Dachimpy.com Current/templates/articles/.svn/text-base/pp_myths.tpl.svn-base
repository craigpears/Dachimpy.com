<h1>PP Myths</h1>
<p style="font-style:italic">Note that this article is subject to change</p>
<p>As with anything, there are a lot of myths in Puzzle Pirates, some are the result of game mechanics being hidden, others are because the reality is complicated, 
some of them I swear people must have been smoking something when they came up with them.</p>
<h3>I'm useless at dnav</h3>
<p>Most people get very demoralised at duty navigation.  The truth about this puzzle is that it is just very difficult to perform at lower star levels.
I have won duty nav competitions and gotten a #1 trophy, and even I can't get more than a poor the first league on a low star level.  So ignore the indicator and
try to judge yourself in other ways, like how many mistakes you are making.</p>
<h3>Kill the guy with the hat!</h3>
<p>This is the one that I think people must have been high for, why would killing someone with a hat make any difference?  More than that, from a practical standpoint,
why would the developers working on the game use their time to do something like this?  If they are doing this stuff, then they really have too much time on their hands.</p>
<h3>Poker is about luck</h3>
<p>Nothing could be further from the truth.  Ok, you can get unlucky on one hand or one day or even a week.  In the long run though, poker is all about skill.  In my 
experience on Puzzle Pirates, the biggest factors affecting your ability to play poker are maths(various calculations on pot odds, probabilities etc.) and
psychological factors, like can you keep a clear objective mind when things don't go your way, can you remain disciplined and can you figure out the probability
of what someone has based on their history and current actions?  Try looking into techniques to improve at each, like multi-tasking to keep yourself
calmer and more disciplined, or learn how to calculate pot odds to make more informed decisions instead of blaming luck.</p>
<h3>Bots grappling gives you a higher score!</h3>
<p>For this one, again, I refer you to my comments on the hats myth.  How does this make any sense?  I've never seen a shred of evidence to back up a claim like this,
nor can I see any logic behind it.
<h3>Success flags must be bullies</h3>
<p>While I'm sure some big, successful flags do bully others, most of the ones that people perceive that way are simply having fun.  They love the thrill
of blockading and want to do it at every opportunity, so they will go around and drop on islands.  Please don't create hate campaigns against these guys
just because you don't think you can win any other way, it's not a nice way to be.</p>
