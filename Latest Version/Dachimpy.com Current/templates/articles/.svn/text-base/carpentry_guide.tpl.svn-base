<h1>Carpentry Guide</h1>
<p style="font-style:italic">Note that this article is subject to change</p>
<p>My guides have been built around the idea of comprehensive understanding and doing drills for a while now.
   The best example of this has been my rigging guide, that encourages several techniques that are meant to build up skills to be used later.
   In this guide, I will describe the process of how to learn carpentry as explicitly as possible.</p>

<h3>Step One, understand the puzzle mechanics</h3>

<p>Everything relies on a fundamental understanding of how the puzzle mechanics work.  
   This first step is designed for you to develop an awareness of how much you know.</p>

 

<h4>Exercise One</h4>
<p>Exercise Objective: Develop your understanding of the puzzle mechanics</p>
<p>In three minutes, write down a brief description of carpentry puzzle controls.   
   It doesn't need to be an in depth explanation, a bullet pointed list of the main ideas is fine.  
   For example, it might contain 'you fiddle with the wheel thingie-mi-bob whatsit on the mouse to rotate the pieces'.  
   Use a timing device to make sure that you don't spend too long on this.</p>

 

<p>Most of you will fall into the category of not even knowing what I mean by puzzle mechanics.  
   If that's the case, take a brief look at the <a href="http://yppedia.puzzlepirates.com/Carpentry">wiki page</a> for carpentry.</p>

<p>If you can recall lots of detail, that means that you have a good deep understanding of the puzzle, this is good.</p>
<p>If you find that you can recognize most of the ideas on the wiki page, but are unable to come up with them on your own then this probably means that you have a shallow understanding of the puzzle mechanics.  If you do the drills and exercises in this guide, then this understanding will develop as you go through.</p>

<h4>Before you go on to the next step</h4>
<p>If you learn best by doing something, then open up the wiki page and the carpentry puzzle and experiment with each mechanic to get a deeper understanding of it.
   If you prefer to see it being done, I'll be putting up some videos on the basic puzzle mechanics to support this guide soon.</p>

<p>It can be very tempting to skip this practice and just go onto the next part of the guide, but this practice is what is going to help improve your rank.</p>

<h3>Step Two, develop your understanding of how the puzzle is scored</h3>


<h4>Exercise Two</h4>

<p>Exercise Objective: Develop awareness of your scoring knowledge</p>

<p>The next step in improving at carpentry is getting a solid grasp of the scoring of the puzzle.   
   The first step as before, is to spend three minutes writing what you know about the scoring of the puzzle.  
   What are the things that affect the score?  Again, use a timing device to make sure that you don't spend to long on this.  
   Remember that this is meant to make you more aware of what you know or don't know, don't feel pressured.</p>

<hr>

 

<p>There are lots of things that affect the scoring, the most important things that you should know if you don't already are that your speed affects your score, the number of pieces that overlap affect your score and completing a hole with no overlapping pieces results in a masterpiece, which gives you a good bonus and these master pieces can be chained together for an even bigger bonus.</p>

<h4>Exercise Three</h4>

<p>Objective: Get an understanding of how speed affects your score</p>

<p>The best way to see that speed affects your scoring, is to use the starting puzzle on a pirate that hasn't played carpentry before, the one where you get given a three-piece hole that you can easily make into a master piece.  
    Try placing the first piece, and then waiting a minute before placing the second and another minute before placing the third and see what happens to the hammer.  
    If this doesn't convince you, then experiment with playing fast and slow and see how it affects the hammer.</p>

 

<p>The aim of this guide will be to create master pieces and to improve your speed, these two things however will be done separately.  
   So when you are doing drills to improve your master pieces, you don't need to worry about your speed.  
   Similarly, when you are improving your speed, you don't need to worry about your master pieces.</p>

 
<h4>Before you go onto the next step</h4>
<p>Once you feel that you have a good grasp of what affects your score in carpentry by completing these exercises, you can go on to the next step.</p>
